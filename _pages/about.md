About Me
======
Hi there, welcome to my website! My name is Hui Liu.

I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Industrial and Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech, starting in Fall 2024. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Ran Jin. Prior to this, I received both my B.Eng and M.Eng degrees in Information Management from Renmin University of China, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Chaolemen.

My current research focuses on text data sharing in manufacturing, as well as data transfer across different machines and tasks. If you're interested in collaboration or would like to chat, feel free to get in touch!

The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
